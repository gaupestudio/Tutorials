# Install Network manager
[Go back](Network.md)

Go to Gaupe/Netcode/Create Network Manager
TODO: Insert picture

Click on the Network manager in the Inspector.
**Player Prefab:** is a prefab that gets instantiated every time a player joins!
**Network Prefabs List:** this is all the Network Objects that can be instantiated and destroyed.
**Network Transport:** this does not matter, this is only when we need to go advanced. Please do not change this!
**Buttons:** we wont use these buttons for testing. But it is sometimes useful!
**Unity Transport:** the information when connecting to a server.
**Allow Remote Connections:** this is when you relase the game, this will allow others to join.

# Adding the testing buttons!
[Go back](Network.md)
This is very easy! 
Go to Gaupe/Netcode/Create Testing Buttons!

This is ui buttons, instead of the buttons on Network manager, when we build.

Go ahead and play it. Use a host!

**Congratulations you finished Install Gaupe.Netcode & Testing Buttons**
